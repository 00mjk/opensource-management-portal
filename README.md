## azureopensource-portal

The Azure Open Source Portal for GitHub is the culmination of years of trying to manage the 
Azure presence on GitHub through a lot of trial, error, and improvement in tooling.

Starting as a hackathon, today it is used to manage a number of organizations on GitHub at 
an enterprise-grade scale by automating organization onboarding and delegating management 
decisions to team maintainers.
