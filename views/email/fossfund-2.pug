  h4 Voting is now open.
  p Thanks for contributing to open source in March. Voting is now open.

  h3 You can now vote at #[a(href='https://aka.ms/fossfund') https://aka.ms/fossfund]

  p We experienced such a rush of nominations that we had to pare down the first month to keep the voting ballot reasonable. We are working with the Open Source Champs and GitHub Sponsors to improve the nomination experience for the April/May voting period that will start soon.
  p The nomination experience will be more interactive (and we will show you other nominated projects at the same time) in the next round. Any projects you had hoped would make the final cut for nominations can always appear in a future month.
  p Thank you!

  if openContributions && openContributions.length
    p: strong Thanks for making #{openContributions.length} open source contribution#{openContributions.length === 1 ? '' : 's'} in the open on GitHub in March.

  h2 Contributing in the open
  p We are trying to drive a change across Microsoft. We'd like to see more Microsofties contributing to open source communities, whether as part of your role, a Day of Learning project, updating project dependencies, hobbies, or pursuing off-hours projects and interests.

  h2 About the FOSS Fund
  p Microsoft's Open Source Programs Office, 1ES (One Engineering System), and GitHub are launching the first FOSS Fund program at Microsoft. #[a(href='https://engineering.indeedblog.com/blog/2019/07/foss-fund-six-months-in/') They are inspired by Indeed's efforts] to drive employee participation in open source and support open source projects that companies depend on.
  p Starting in April 2020, Microsoft's FOSS Fund will give $10,000 to the most-voted-for open source software project. Projects are nominated and selected by those at Microsoft who contribute to communities that are not primarily  Microsoft communities.

  h3 Nominated projects
  p Projects must:
  ul
    li Be used by Microsoft
    li Have an OSI-approved license such as MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL, etc.
    li Must have a mechanism for receiving funds (the GitHub Sponsors team may be able to help)
    li Cannot be a Microsoft employee-led project

  h3 Voter eligibility
  p Eligible voters:
  ul
    li Must have a linked GitHub account at #[a(href='https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com') https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com]
    li Must be an FTE or intern
    li Must have contributed in the open to at least one project on GitHub beyond Microsoft's governance during the Redmond calendar month. Contributions to your own repos or to forks of Microsoft projects are not included.
    li Contributions include opening and merging pull requests, opening issues, discussing issues, performing code reviews of pull requests, etc.
